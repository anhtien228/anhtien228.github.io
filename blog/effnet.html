                            There is no doubt that machine learning is becoming well-known these days not only to
                            developer, but also common businesses due to its simplicity, all thanks to the efforts of
                            the creator to make the libraries, tools and framework to be more concise and user-friendly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As as student that major in Computer Science and Engineering, my interests in Data Science and ML has been charmed
                            with the appearance of the Machine Learning Engineer course by DIVE INTO CODE. Being a learner for more than one
                            year, the course has convey a lot of useful theories and practical problem to brush my skills. This report is
                            conducted to demonstrate the final assignment for my graduation at DIVE INTO CODE, and everything here is served to
                            describe my work in details.

                            For the project, I chose to participate to a contest called

                            online competition for Vietnam’s AI engineers to explore AI technologies and impact life in exciting new ways. In
                            2021, the competition consist of 3 main problems, and my work is related to one of them, the

                        <p>
                            In this section, I will briefly explain about the meaning of the name, the description and rules of the challenge,
                            and the dataset that need to be interpreted on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Covid-19 outbreak, the Vietnamese government pushed the "5K" public health safety message. In the
                            message, masking and keeping a safe distance are two key rules that have been shown to be extremely successful in
                            preventing people from contracting or spreading the virus. Enforcing these principles on a large scale is where
                            technology may help. In this challenge, you will create algorithm to detect whether or not a person or group of
                            individuals in a picture adhere to the <b class="text-cyan">mask</b> and <b class="text-cyan">distance</b> standards.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="text-center link link-underline mb-4" style="width: fit-content; cursor: auto">
                            <b>Basic rules</b>
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            We are given the dataset contains images of people either wearing mask or not and they are standing either close of
                            far from each other. Our mission is to predict whether the formation of these people adhere the 5k standard.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 5k standard is also based on the two conditions, mask (0 = not wearing, 1 = wearing) and distancing (0 = too
                            close, 1 = far enough). People that adhere the 5k standard will not likely to expose the virus to each other in case
                            they did caught it before, and it is to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandamic through people interactions.
